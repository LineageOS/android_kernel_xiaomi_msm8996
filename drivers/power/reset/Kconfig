config POWER_RESET_GPIO
	bool "GPIO power-off driver"
	depends on OF_GPIO
	help
	  This driver supports turning off your board via a GPIO line.
	  If your board needs a GPIO high/low to power down, say Y and
	  create a binding in your devicetree.

config POWER_RESET_GPIO_RESTART
	bool "GPIO restart driver"
	depends on OF_GPIO
	help
	  This driver supports restarting your board via a GPIO line.
	  If your board needs a GPIO high/low to restart, say Y and
	  create a binding in your devicetree.

	depends on ARCH_HISI
	help
	  Reboot support for Hisilicon boards.

config POWER_RESET_LTC2952
	bool "LTC2952 PowerPath power-off driver"
	depends on OF_GPIO
	help
	  This driver supports an external powerdown trigger and board power
	  down via the LTC2952. Bindings are made in the device tree.

config POWER_RESET_MSM
	bool "Qualcomm MSM power-off driver"
	depends on ARCH_MSM || ARCH_QCOM
	depends on POWER_RESET
	help
	  Power off and restart support for Qualcomm boards.

config MSM_DLOAD_MODE
	bool "Qualcomm download mode"
	depends on POWER_RESET_MSM
	help
		This makes the SoC enter download mode when it resets
		due to a kernel panic. Note that this doesn't by itself
		make the kernel reboot on a kernel panic - that must be
		enabled via another mechanism.

config MSM_PRESERVE_MEM
	bool "Always preserve memory on restart"
	depends on POWER_RESET_MSM
	help
	  If crash to download mode is disabled and restart reason is null
	  the system will always perform a hard reset, which wipes out
	  persistent memory contents. Select this option to always perform
	  a soft reset that preserves memory contents.

config POWER_RESET_QNAP
	bool "QNAP power-off driver"
	depends on OF_GPIO && PLAT_ORION
	help
	  This driver supports turning off QNAP NAS devices by sending
	  commands to the microcontroller which controls the main power.

	  Say Y if you have a QNAP NAS.

config POWER_RESET_RESTART
	bool "Restart power-off driver"
	depends on ARM
	help
	  Some boards don't actually have the ability to power off.
	  Instead they restart, and u-boot holds the SoC until the
	  user presses a key. u-boot then boots into Linux.
